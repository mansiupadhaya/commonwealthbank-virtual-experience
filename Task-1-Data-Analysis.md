This task marked my first experience using Splunk Enterprise, a powerful tool for data analysis and visualisation

Initially, I spent some time familiarising myself with its interface and functionalities. Being new to Splunk, the task guide provided helped me quickly learn how to import datasets, explore data fields, and build a dashboard through the platform's user-friendly features and documentation. The objective of this task was to uncover trends and patterns in fraud-related data and create a dashboard.

## Steps taken 
- Installed Splunk Enterprise and imported the dataset
- Explored the dataset using Splunk's search and analysis tools.
- Created a dashboard with various charts and tables to represent the key insights.

I created a dashboard (see screenshot below) that visually represented key metrics through charts, graphs, and tables. The dashboard made it easier to identify patterns and trends present in the dataset provided. This visual representation effectively demonstrated how data-driven decision-making can enhance fraud detection efforts.
