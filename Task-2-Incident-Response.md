# Incident Response

Task 2 involved analysing a cyber incident and responding to it effectively. I was provided with a timeline of events detailing a phishing attack targeting employee credentials and the subsequent spread of malware. The challenge required identifying the attack type and outlining the comprehensive steps for containment, resolution and recovery.

## Steps Taken
* Analysed the timeline of events, including the deceptive HR eemail, its impact on employees and the discovery of malwaree affecting file-shares.
* Recognised the incident as a phishing attack due to the impersonation of HR, the fake login portal, and the malware deployment.
* Suggested isolating affected devices to prevent further compromise. Recommended disabling compromised accounts to limit unauthorised access.
* Conducted an analysis of the phishing email and fake website to understand the attack's origin and techniques.
* Drafted recovery actions including suggesting implementing MFA and conducting employee training to strengthen future defences.
* Suggested post-incident activities that included the recommendation of documenting the incident, performing a lessons-learned analysis and updating response procedures.

This task enhanced my understanding of phishing attacks and the critical steps required to contain, resolve and recover from such incidents. It also reinforced the importance of proactive measures like employee awareness training. 

I particularly enjoyed the analytical aspect of this task, which involved dissecting the phishing email and understanding its impact. I found it incredibly interesting to apply theoretical knowledge to a realistic scenario.
