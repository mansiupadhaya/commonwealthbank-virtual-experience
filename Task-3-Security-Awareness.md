# Task 3 - Security Awareness

Drawing from my placement experience in 2023-24, where I created a cybersecurity awareness presentation for employees, I found myself well prepared for this task. The prior experience proved invaluable in creating an education and visually impactful resource. 

## Steps Taken

1. Researched Australian Cyber Security Centre's (ACSC) recommendations for creating strong and secure passwords.
2. Used Canva to create a visually appealing and informative infographic tailored to educate employees on password security.
3. Produced a clear and concise PDF that highlighted the importance of secure passwords and offered practical tips for employees.

This task focused on security awareness allowed me to make use of my prior experience which made the process efficient and improved the quality of the final product produced. Designing the infographic was an enjoyable experience, as it allowed me to combine creativity with technical knowledge. It was fulfilling to see how my past experience contributed to creating an impactful educational resource.
