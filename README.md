# âœ¨Commonwealth Bank Cybersecurity Virtual Experience âœ¨

This repository showcases my participation in the Commonwealth Bank's Introduction to Cybersecurity Virtual Job Simulation, provided by Forage, completed in December 2024. This virtual internship allowed me to gain hands-on experience across various cybersecurity domains, including data analysis, incident response, security awareness, and penetration testing through the practical tasks provided by Commonwealth Bank in the Virtual Experience Program.

## Skills learned ðŸŒŸ
Through the Commonwealth Bank Cybersecurity Virtual Experience, I honed a diverse set of technical and analytical skills that are integral to cybersecurity roles. These include:
* Cybersecurity Fundamentals: Detection and response, incident triage and penetration testing.
* Data proficiency: Data analysis, visualisation and protection using tools like Splunk.
* Security Practices: Compliance knowledge, password security, and best practices.
* Soft skills: Creative thinking and problem-solving to address dynamic challenges in the cybersecurity landscape.

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience, as it provided a practical, hands-on approach to understanding key cybersecurity concepts. The tasks not only allowed me to work on improving my technical skills, but also helped me think critically about cybersecurity issues in a business context.
